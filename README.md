Matrix is a liner algebra library for Go, designed for ease of use and speed. The main reason for developing this library was to implement some new methods for determining different matrix decompositions - as well as to implement more complicated models such as a [Kalman Filter](https://github.com/kochie/kalman-filter).

The documentation is avaliable [here](https://godoc.org/github.com/kochie/matrix)
